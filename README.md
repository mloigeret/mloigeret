Hey there!
I'm Manuel. I'm an iOS engineer. I haven't put a lot of stuff on GitHub because I always found myself working on Bitbucket repos but I'm starting to add a couple things on here.
When I'm not making iOS app, I run, bike, play with my 2 kids. I also make beats from time to time.
If you want to say, your best bet is my [twitter](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
